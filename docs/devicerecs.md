# What Device Should I Buy?

## Best Daily Carry (EDC)
If you are looking for a reliable, rugged, and water-resistant node with a 5-day battery life, the **T1000-E** from Seeed Studio is a great choice. You can purchase it directly from [Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Card-Tracker-T1000-E-for-Meshtastic-p-5913.html?qid=VVLLAQ_f83zcvqx_1766178728865) or on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3KUMsXc).

## Solar Node Recommendations

### Pre-made Solar Nodes
If you prefer a "plug-and-play" solution that is weather-ready out of the box, the **SenseCAP P1** or **P1 Pro** from [Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Solar-Node-P1-for-Meshtastic-LoRa-p-6425.html) are excellent choices. These units integrate the solar controller and enclosure, saving you significant assembly time.

The **P1** is $35 cheaper as it does not include batteries or GPS; you will need to supply four 18650 batteries yourself. By comparison, the **P1 Pro** includes everything you need to get started, including an integrated GPS module.

### Solar Nodes to Build
For those DIYing their own solar enclosures, these two boards are the best in class:

* **RAK WisMesh:** Highly recommended for its industry-leading power efficiency. Buy from: [Rak Wireless](https://store.rokland.com/collections/rakwireless-products/products/rak-wireless-wisblock-meshtastic-starter-kit), [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3MQtcun)
* **Heltec V4:** A more powerful alternative, for a slightly cheaper price. Buy from: [Heltec Automation](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v4/), [Amazon](https://amzn.to/48YZfQb)

| Board | Strength | Trade-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAK WisMesh** | Extreme power efficiency | Slightly lower TX power |
| **Heltec V4** | Higher transmit power | Higher power consumption |
