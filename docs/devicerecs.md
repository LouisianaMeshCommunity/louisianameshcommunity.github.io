## Solar Node Recommendations

### Pre-made Solar Nodes
If you prefer a "plug-and-play" solution that is weather-ready out of the box, the **SenseCAP P1** or **P1 Pro** from [Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Solar-Node-P1-for-Meshtastic-LoRa-p-6425.html?sensecap_affiliate=Je7dGgm&referring_service=link) are excellent choices. These units integrate the solar controller and enclosure, saving you significant assembly time. you can recieve a 5% discount by code S9ZRMA1X at checkout.

The **P1** is $35 cheaper as it does not include batteries or GPS; you will need to supply four 18650 batteries yourself. By comparison, the **P1 Pro** includes everything you need to get started, including an integrated GPS module.

### Repeater Nodes to Build
For those DIYing their own repeater or solar enclosures, here are some boards we recommend.

#### Top Picks:
